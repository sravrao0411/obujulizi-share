# Obujulizi Share
### Front End: Flutter

This repository contains only the code I was responsible for.

My project partner, [Aastha Khare](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aastha-khare-221140142/), and I co-developed Obujulizi Share for our [senior design](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/undergraduate/senior-design/2023-senior-design/) project at Santa Clara University's undergraduate engineering school. We created Obujulizi Share for [Rose Academies](https://roseacademies.org/), a non-profit organization that helps impoverished communities based in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Members of these communities lack proper technical infrastructure to communicate their issues and find support.  Obujulizi Share is a centralized, secure, and accessible system that allows these communities to find support in ways they couldn't before.
their experiences. Our project consisted of three parts: an interview application, where Rose Academies’ creative team can take and record interviews, a content managing application to allow the creative team to select compelling interviews and write stories about them, and a final application that displays these stories for viewing. This system will allow Rose Academies to gather valuable insights and understanding of each community’s needs, enabling them
to provide more targeted support.

# The Three Parts
Interviewing - Android Application: Designed to allow users to create an account and sign
in; the credentials created on this application will allow access to the Content Managing and Stories applications.
After signing in and accepting Rose Academies’ privacy policy, users are directed to the home page. The home
page displays a list of profiles that have previously interviewed with the organization. Each profile page consists of
relevant information, such as name, contact information, and a list of interviews for each interviewee. Users can create
profiles and add new interviews for a profile by reviewing the interview guide, recording a digital signature, where the
interviewee consents to giving an interview, before finally uploading new interview data.

Content Managing - Web Application: Serves as a platform for users to manage incoming
interview data from the Interviews application. Each interview has a default status of ”pending.” Users can select an
interview to view its details, set its approval status, and create a story based on the interview content. Users also have
the option to create a story directly from a list of approved interviews. They can choose to save their draft or publish
the story.

Story Sharing - Android Application: Allows users to view published stories generated from the Content Managing application. Stories are presented in a list format, and users may use the search functionality in the top
bar to search for stories based on keywords. Users can also choose to read stories of their interest from the list.

# Project Attributes
###  User Interface Design

#### Color Palette and Visual Hierarchy
All three apps maintain clean and simple user interfaces using a carefully selected color palette. The colors were chosen to emphasize certain sections of the app and provide a clear visual hierarchy. For instance, important buttons and sections are highlighted with bright colors, while less important elements use softer tones.

#### Accessibility
We've designed the app to be user-friendly, with an intuitive flow that guides users naturally from one section to another. You can easily perform tasks by following the on-screen instructions and using the clearly labeled buttons. The UI also utilized clear font styles in sans-serif font families, to make the text easier to read for users.

### Code Architecture
We have designed our Flutter code to be structured using a feature-first folder structure, which promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The codebase is organized into three main folders, each representing a distinct app within our project. Additionally, we have dedicated folders for utilities and widget components to enhance code organization and reusability.

### Flutter Framework
We strived to utilize Flutter's open-source documentation and various available packages. We chose the Flutter framework because it allows us to create applications that run seamlessly on multiple platforms from a single codebase. This means we can reach our users on both mobile and web without the overhead of maintaining separate codebases. Flutter's hot reload feature has also significantly accelerated our development process, allowing us to iterate rapidly and fine-tune our user interfaces.
