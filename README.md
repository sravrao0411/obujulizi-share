# Obujulizi Share
This repository contains only the code I was responsible for.

My project partner, [Aastha Khare](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aastha-khare-221140142/), and I co-developed Obujulizi Share for our [senior design](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/undergraduate/senior-design/2023-senior-design/) project at Santa Clara University's undergraduate engineering school. We created obujulizi share for Rose Academies, a non-profit organization that helps impoverished communities based in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Members of these communities lack proper technical infrastructure to communicate their issues and find support.  Obujulizi Share is a centralized, secure, and accessible system that allows these communities to find support in ways they couldn't before.
their experiences. Our project consisted of three parts: an interview application, where Rose Academies’ creative team can take and record interviews, a content managing application to allow the creative team to select compelling interviews and write stories about them, and a final application that displays these stories for viewing. This system will allow Rose Academies to gather valuable insights and understanding of each community’s needs, enabling them
to provide more targeted support.
